Getting hand dirty :
====================

- add a proportionnal retaliaton reponse from threat :
	- calculate player firepower
	- calculate player "rapid" firepower
	- calculate player "air" firepower
		raid = hit & run
	- calculate player tobase-raid firepower (sonic,launcher)
	- calculate player toharvester-raid firepower (air,trike,squad,launcher, light tanks)

- when player cannot retaliate, it s a danger to adress with unit build order of anti-threat unit types
- when build orders cannot be adress, it s cannot retaliate per se, adress with a structure build order 
- Opportunity to retaliate is to enhanced (now its auto retaliate, even if this is suicide) :
		-	 firepower of retaliate squad vs damager's
		-	 

AI is dumb make it smart
==========================

- Should acquire intelligence : Know where the spice is, where the enemy is, where to expand
	- Mapping of the base should focus on  :
		+ static defensive power
		+ mobile defensive power,
		+ raffinery industries 
		+ power/spice supply (punitive raid or pre-massive attack raid)
 		+ unit production facilities (do lower production)
		+ radar placement (for shutdown)
	- Build recon squad, make raid to test defense
		+ balance benefits/risks/costs
		+ always scout out for new base establishement somewhere (on rock) 
		+ always scout out for new spice field (which one is controlled by enemy) 

- Should be able to plan build orders correponding to tactics and pragmatically to sketch a big plan strategy
