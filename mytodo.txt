Getting hand dirty :
====================

- add a proportionnal retaliaton reponse from threat :
	- calculate player firepower
	- calculate player "rapid" firepower
	- calculate player "air" firepower
		raid = hit & run
	- calculate player tobase-raid firepower (sonic,launcher)
	- calculate player toharvester-raid firepower (air,trike,squad,launcher, light tanks)

- when player cannot retaliate, it s a danger to adress with unit build order of anti-threat unit types
- when build orders cannot be adress, it s cannot retaliate per se, adress with a structure build order 
- Opportunity to retaliate is to enhanced (now its auto retaliate, even if this is suicide) :
		-	 firepower of retaliate squad vs damager's
		-	 

AI is dumb make it smart : create a new
==========================


- Should be able to evaluate threat
	- notably decide whether an enemy attack is a raid or light one or the big one.b

- Should acquire intelligence : Know where the spice is, where the enemy is, where to expand
	- Mapping of the base should focus on  :
		+ static defensive power
		+ mobile defensive power,
		+ raffinery industries 
		+ power/spice supply (punitive raid or pre-massive attack raid)
 		+ unit production facilities (do lower production)
		+ radar placement (for shutdown)
	- Build recon squad, make raid to test defense
		+ balance benefits/risks/costs
		+ always scout out for new base establishement somewhere (on rock) 
		+ always scout out for new spice field (which one is controlled by enemy) 

- Should be able to plan build orders correponding to tactics and pragmatically to sketch a big plan strategy

        
        
        
Current
========

1. Harvester behavior concerning threat (worms, enemies)
	- Prevent harvester to go back to spice field if it's under the threat of a sworm (find a new spot)
	- evaluate spice field threats
	- new function to find spice not only based on shortest distance


3. Minor House are imba, I want to extend major house capabilities and give specificities to minor house, as such:

Atreides Palace : Allied with the fremen. Palace should produce respondable fremen that are trained in the way of the voice. 
	- like sonic tanks except it will no cost any power
	- doesn't appear on the radar & are hidden whist not moving, they should turn into a feared ambush force as well as a good source of intel.

Harkonnen Palace : Allied with Corino. Harkonnen already benefit what is considered the most imba superweapon in the game. 
But in this extension, I might be willing to grant it the capability to bury mines when a missile hits the ground 
without any structures or enemy nearby. And probably set the same reload time as the other house.
	- Mines will look like spice blooms
	- setting double reloadtime seemed as a necessity to (try to ) rebalance game between the other faction. It should be
	made obsolete by this extension redesign. This detered the gameplay, we'll recover the only offset that should exist
	between faction superweapon : the time the house start building the superweapon. 

Ordos Palace : Allied with the Tleilaxu. As for now Sabotor is a weak superweapon. 
In this extension, I want it to be capable of a discreetly sabotage vehicules 
(a sort of destructive nanoparticules) & units (a sort of poisonning) while still be able to commit suicide on buildings. 
I want to give him a better viewrange and become a source of intel.
	- Sabotage vehicules & unit : use the degradebuilding & apply it to them, 
inssure sabotor will stay shrouded until spotted. Could be spot only by a radar (an extended radar view range)
	- Explode vehicule : after planing explosive, saboter can use a remote (10 tiles) 
control to trig explosive (same as the desvastator's autodestruct area damage)

Fremen Palace : Allied with Sha√Ø-Ulud. Palace should produce fremens that calls & rides worms. As worm prefers attack harvester and heavy unit, freemens would
could spread havok around enemy harvestering ops and defend the worms from ornithoper attacks (indeed actually they are
really overpow. against worms!) and shoot them in air.
	- Sandworm should be considered to have a cargo (as frigate)
	- Riding freemen would travel the same speed as worm while also revealing map
		

Sardokar Palace : Allied with the Space Guild. Give sardokar the ability to call elite sardokars troops reinforcement anywhere on the map.
	- pretty much like mechanics of the fremen, except we can order a drop place precisely.
	- use the frigate dropship, reusing in fact the reinforcement mechanics
	- reintroduce the sardokar unit (replaced by regular troopers) 
	- CHOAM price will drop for 2 minutes (cut off transport tax)
 
Mercenary Palace : Allied with the desert smugglers. Ability to build village at 10 tiles distance form map border. 
This village will not be not visible on the radar and offer smugglers services.

Services will be really cheap harvesters (half cost), ornis (half cost) and regular troopers (half cost)
	- this village has about the same view range the radar has. 
	- reuse CHOAM market principle on those unit, time to order timer should be made 2 minutes or so
	- smugglers blackmarket offers very cheap prices but very low quantities.
	- make use of the frigate dropship, reusing the reinforcement mechanics. The frigate should appear clocked (use worm shimmermask)
	- the village will look like part of the wor, or the starport
