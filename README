The program Dune Legacy is an modernized clone of the excellent Westwood Studios game "Dune 2". It is ridiculusly easy to find
Dune2 on the net anyways, but I won't provide it.  I think you can still even buy it from Westwood studios, so do that.
There exists a mod called Superdune 2. The PAK-Files Superdune 2 provides are nearly the same except SCENARIO.PAK.
 
This program would not have been created without the use of the excellent SDL library and its extensions.  Thanks guys :).


Getting Started
---------------

The following PAK-files from the original Dune 2 are needed to play Dune Legacy:
	HARK.PAK
	ATRE.PAK
	ORDOS.PAK
	ENGLISH.PAK
	DUNE.PAK
	SCENARIO.PAK
	MENTAT.PAK
	VOC.PAK
	MERC.PAK
	FINALE.PAK
	INTRO.PAK
	INTROVOC.PAK
	SOUND.PAK
	GERMAN.PAK (for playing in German)
	FRENCH.PAK (for playing in French)

It depends on your system and installation where to put these files. LEGACY.PAK is supplied with Dune Legacy and is already
in the data directory. All the other files should be copied there too. If you are not allowed to copy files there you may
copy these files inside the dunelegacy configuration directory (e.g. ~/.config/dunelegacy/data/ on unix).

Linux:
It depends on how the game was compiled. Normally you should put these files under /usr/share/dunelegacy/ or /usr/local/share/dunelegacy/ .
Just look for LEGACY.PAK. If you do not have root access to your system you should put them in your home directory under ~/.config/dunelegacy/data/ .

Windows:
The installer has already asked for the files and put them in the installation directory. If not put the PAK-files inside your installation folder or 
if you do not have administrator privileges you should put them to C:\Documents and Settings\<YourName>\Application Data\dunelegacy\data\ .


MAC OS X:
The PAK-files have to be copied inside the application bundle. If you have followed the steps in the supplied dmg you have already copied them there.
Otherwise just right-click on the bundle and select "Show Bundle Content". Then navigate into "Contents" and then into "Resources". There you will 
find LEGACY.PAK. Put the other PAK-files there too. Alternativly you can put them in your home directory under ~/.config/dunelegacy/data/ but putting 
them inside the application bundle is the preferred way.

Configuration file
------------------

If you want to fine tune the configuration of Dune Legacy you might want to take a look at the configuration file "Dune Legacy.ini". Depending on your system it 
is either placed in ~/.config/dunelegacy (on Linux), ~/Library/Application Support/Dune Legacy (on Mac OS X) or in C:\Documents and Settings\<YourName>\Application Data\dunelegacy\ (on Windows).


Internet Game
-------------

To play online via Internet you have to manually enable port forwarding if you use a NAT Router. Forward the Dune Legacy Server Port (Default is 28747) from your NAT Router to your computer. Use the same port on your router as configured in Dune Legacy.
Example: If your machine has IP 192.168.123.1 and your using the default Dune Legacy Port, than forward port 28747 from your router to 192.168.123.1:28747.

This file provides information on how to build and install Dune Legacy.

Prerequirements
---------------

- gcc or any other standard compliant C++ compiler
- autotools
- SDL 1.2
- SDL-mixer


Building
--------

Dune Legacy can read the needed data from different locations. If you want 
to keep everything in one directory you should use the first method. You also
may decide to install Dune Legacy on your system. The use the second method.

Method 1: Data read from local directory
----------------------------------------
Extract the Dune Legacy source code and run at the top level directory
the following command:

autoreconf --install
./buildlocal.sh

This will configure and build Dune Legacy and you will find afterwards
a "dunelegacy" binary in the top level directory. The data is read from
the data subdirectory. There you shoud copy all the PAK-files from Dune 2

Method 2: Install Dune Legacy on your system
--------------------------------------------
Extract the Dune Legacy source code and run at the top level directory
the following commands:

autoreconf --install
./configure
make
make install

You may decide to change configure's default prefix to something else, e.g.
./configure --prefix=/usr



Updating localization
---------------------

Dune Legacy uses po files as generated by gettext. To update the template file data/locale/dunelegacy.pot and update the localizations in the *.po files run

./updatelocale.sh

To create a new locale run the following command (replacing "de" with your locale)

msginit --locale=de --input=dunelegacy.pot --output=German.de.po



Packaging/Distributions
------------

Source:
To package the source code go to the build directory and type

make dist-bzip2

This creates dunelegacy-?.tar.bz2. You might want to add a "src" to the name to get dunelegacy-?-src.tar.bz2


Debian/Ubuntu:
Make sure you have the following packages installed: build-essential, debhelper, autoconf, libsdl1.2-dev and libsdl-mixer1.2-dev
Extract the source code from the bz2 file and change inside the source root directory (which contains configure). From there you run the following command:

dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot

You will get a dunelegacy_0.96-1_*.deb file one directory above.


Fedora:
You need the source tarball (see Packaging/Source in this file) and the following packages: rpm-build, gcc, gcc-c++, libstdc++-devel, SDL-devel, SDL_mixer-devel. Then run the following command:

rpmbuild -tb dunelegacy-?-src.tar.bz2

Under ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/<arch> you will find the created rpm file.


Gentoo:
There is an ebuild available. Go to your local portage tree and create the directory games-strategy/dunelegacy. Put the ebuild there and run

ebuild dunelegacy-?.ebuild digest
emerge dunelegacy


Mac OS X:
Open the XCode-Project from IDE/xCode/Dune Legacy.xcodeproj and build Dune Legacy. The resulting bundle will be put under IDE/xCode/build/Release.
Now go to the folder MacOSX and extract Dune Legacy.dmg.zip and then mount Dune Legacy.dmg. Put the compiled Dune Legacy bundle into the mounted dmg and unmount it afterwards.
Zip the dmg again to save a lot of download bandwidth.


Windows:
Use Code::Blocks to build the exe which will be placed in the data directory. The following DLLs are needed to run dunelegacy.exe:
libogg-0.dll
libvorbis-0.dll
libvorbisfile-3.dll
SDL.dll
SDL_mixer.dll
smpeg.dll

Copy them in the data directory. To create a installer you need NSIS. Compile dunelegacy.nsi with the NSIS compiler to create the installer.


Cross-compiling Windows Version on Linux:
To compile the Windows version on Linux you need to setup the mingw cross-compiler. On Debian/Ubuntu install the packages gcc-mingw32 and nsis.
You need SDL and SDL-mixer development files for Windows (This is not the same as the development files for Linux):
http://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL-devel-1.2.15-mingw32.tar.gz
http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/release/SDL_mixer-devel-1.2.12-VC.zip

Put the headers under /usr/i686-mingw32msvc/include and the lib files under /usr/i686-mingw32msvc/lib.

To cross-compile and create a Windows installer for Dune Legacy run the following command:

./buildcrosswin32.sh


Running unit tests
------------------

To run the unit tests from the tests directory simply run the following script

./runUnitTests.sh


Running cppcheck
----------------

cppcheck is a static analysis. The following command will run it on the source and write all errors/warnings to cppcheck.log:

cppcheck -j 5 --suppress=cstyleCast --enable=all -I include . 2> cppcheck.log
